# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes sentiment data from social media to understand public opinions across various applications. Using Python and libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`, we perform data exploration, visualization, and downsampling.

## Steps

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**: The dataset is loaded, columns renamed, and missing values checked.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Bar plots show the distribution of IDs and applications.
   - Sentiment distribution is displayed with a pie chart.
   - A heatmap checks for missing data.
3. **Downsampling**: The dataset is balanced by downsampling to prevent sentiment bias.
4. **Label Encoding**: Text labels for sentiment and app are converted to numerical form for analysis.
5. **Final Visualization**: Plots illustrate sentiment distribution across apps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`
